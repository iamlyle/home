    "description": "My programming journey began in high school when I was first introduced to computers and started programming with Visual Basic. I used to spend hours trying to write programs for Excel, which I learned in school. At that time, I had no idea what exciting challenges lay ahead.<br><br>Years later, when I learned about C/C++ and Python, the world seemed to have changed a lot and it made me excited. I started to learn more about embedded programming, automation, robotics, IoT and even artificial intelligence. Since then, I have never stopped, I have learned more every day, and I have had the opportunity to work with great people all over the world.<br><br>Currently, after accumulating a lot of experience, I am still working hard to create new things in my new field, which is programming for mobility devices like cars. I have held a few positions from junior to specialist in several special projects in Ho Chi Minh City. With the desire to bring the most practical values to Vietnam, where I live, I am still constantly looking for new skills, continuously learning and sharing my humble knowledge as much as possible.",
